 To build the design, type 'build' 
 ---------------------------------


 Procedures available in this file:

   build
      Runs the design build

      Optional parameters (to pass more than one parameter use '{}'):
       -no_synth:     Does not run the synthesis.
       -no_impl:      Does not run the implementation (place and route).
       -no_bits:      Does not run the bitstream generation.
       -elaborate:    Generates the elaborated RTL and opens the GUI, ending the script.
       -debug:        Generates the debug probes .ltx file.
       -ins_ila:      Inserts the ILA based on the RTL attributes, without using the GUI. E.g. 'build -ins_ila' or 'build {-ins_ila -no_synth}' if synthesis has been run previously.
       -no_id_update: Do not update the ID block.

   prog_dev
      Program the device through JTAG.
